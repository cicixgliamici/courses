# Cybersecurity: Fundamentals and Frameworks  

## What is Cybersecurity?  
**Cybersecurity** refers to practices, technologies, and processes designed to protect systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage. It addresses threats like malware, phishing, ransomware, and insider threats to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital assets.

## Three Components of Cybersecurity  

| Component            | Description                                                                 | Examples                                                                 |  
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Digital Security** | Protects software, networks, and data from cyberattacks                    | Firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection systems (IDS)                |  
| **Human Security**   | Focuses on user behavior and awareness to prevent human-related vulnerabilities | Phishing training, strong password policies, role-based access control |  
| **Physical Security**| Safeguards hardware and facilities from physical threats                    | Biometric access, surveillance cameras, secure server rooms            |

## The CIA Triad: Core Objectives  

The **CIA Triad** is the foundation of cybersecurity strategies:  

| Objective           | Definition                                  | Relevance in Scenarios                                           |  
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Confidentiality** | Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized users | Protects sensitive data (e.g., medical records, financial data)  |  
| **Integrity**       | Maintaining data accuracy and trustworthiness | Prevents tampering (e.g., falsified transaction logs)            |  
| **Availability**    | Guaranteeing reliable access to data/services | Ensures uptime for critical systems (e.g., e-commerce platforms) |  

### Scenario Examples  
- **Healthcare**: Confidentiality of patient records (HIPAA compliance).  
- **Banking**: Integrity of transaction data to prevent fraud.  
- **E-commerce**: Availability of payment gateways during peak traffic.

## Security Controls for the CIA Triad  

### 1. **Confidentiality Controls**  
| Control               | Purpose                                      | Example Implementation                          |  
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|  
| Encryption            | Protect data at rest and in transit          | AES-256 for databases, TLS for web traffic      |  
| Access Control Lists  | Restrict permissions based on roles          | Granting read-only access to junior staff       |  
| Multi-Factor Auth (MFA) | Verify user identity                       | SMS + biometric verification for admin accounts |  

### 2. **Integrity Controls**  
| Control               | Purpose                                      | Example Implementation                          |  
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|  
| Hash Functions         | Detect unauthorized data changes             | SHA-256 checksums for file validation           |  
| Digital Signatures     | Authenticate data sources                    | Signing software updates with RSA keys          |  
| Version Control        | Track and revert unauthorized modifications  | Git for code repositories                       |  

### 3. **Availability Controls**  
| Control               | Purpose                                      | Example Implementation                          |  
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|  
| Redundancy            | Eliminate single points of failure           | Backup servers in multiple data centers         |  
| DDoS Mitigation       | Block traffic overload attacks               | Cloudflareâ€™s anti-DDoS services                 |  
| Disaster Recovery Plan | Restore systems post-incident                | Automated backups tested quarterly              |

## Case Study: Securing a Financial Institution  
- **Confidentiality**: Encrypt customer data and enforce MFA for employee logins.  
- **Integrity**: Use blockchain to audit transaction logs for tampering.  
- **Availability**: Deploy redundant servers across geographic regions.

## Key Takeaways  
1. **CIA Triad**: Balance confidentiality, integrity, and availability based on organizational needs.  
2. **Layered Defense**: Combine digital, human, and physical controls (e.g., encryption + training + biometrics).  
3. **Compliance**: Align controls with standards like GDPR, PCI-DSS, or NIST frameworks.

> **Pro Tip**: Conduct regular **penetration testing** and **security audits** to identify gaps in your CIA controls.
