# Introduction to IBM Watson: Machine Learning & Watson Studio

## Machine Learning Algorithms & Models

### Core Concepts
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Field of AI enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming  
- **Algorithm**: Mathematical procedure for pattern recognition/decision-making (e.g., Decision Trees, Neural Networks)  
- **Model**: Trained representation of data patterns generated by algorithms
