# Artificial Intelligence: Key Concepts

---

## 1. Definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
**Artificial Intelligence** refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines or software. These systems are designed to:  
- Learn from data or experiences (*machine learning*)  
- Reason to solve complex problems  
- Perceive environments (*computer vision, sensors*)  
- Adapt behaviors based on inputs  

**Core Components**:  
- Algorithms (e.g., neural networks, decision trees)  
- Computational power (GPUs/TPUs)  
- Big data (training datasets)  

**Example**:  
    ChatGPT analyzing text patterns to generate human-like responses.

## 2. AI vs. Augmented Intelligence

| **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**        | **Augmented Intelligence**           |  
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
| Operates autonomously                    | Enhances human decision-making        |  
| Aims to replace human tasks              | Designed to collaborate with humans   |  
| Focus: Automation                         | Focus: Amplification                  |  
| **Use Case**: Self-driving cars          | **Use Case**: Medical diagnosis tools |  

**Key Difference**:  
AI seeks independent action, while augmented intelligence acts as a "co-pilot" for human expertise.

## 3. Three Levels of Artificial Intelligence

### Level 1: Narrow AI (Weak AI)  
- **Function**: Specialized in one task  
- **Current Status**: Only existing form today  
- **Examples**:  
    - Facial recognition systems  
    - Spam filters  
    - Recommendation engines  

### Level 2: General AI (Strong AI)  
- **Function**: Human-like reasoning across diverse tasks  
- **Current Status**: Theoretical (not achieved)  
- **Capabilities**:  
    - Transfer learning between domains  
    - Self-awareness  

### Level 3: Superintelligent AI  
- **Function**: Surpasses human cognitive abilities  
- **Current Status**: Hypothetical  
- **Risks/Considerations**:  
    - Ethical control challenges  
    - Existential debates (e.g., "alignment problem")

## 4. Predictions AI Can Make

### A. Healthcare  
- Disease outbreaks (e.g., Google Flu Trends)  
- Patient readmission risks (ML analysis of EHR data)  
- Drug discovery timelines  

### B. Finance  
- Stock price trends (algorithmic trading)  
- Credit default risks (FICO scores with AI enhancements)  
- Fraud detection (anomaly spotting in transactions)  

### C. Climate Science  
- Weather pattern shifts (NOAAâ€™s climate models)  
- Wildfire spread trajectories  
- Carbon emission impacts  

### D. Retail  
- Demand forecasting (inventory optimization)  
- Customer churn likelihood  
- Dynamic pricing adjustments

## 5. Limitations of AI Predictions  
- **Data Bias**: Replicates historical prejudices (e.g., biased hiring algorithms)  
- **Black Box Problem**: Opaque decision logic in deep learning models  
- **Context Blindness**: Struggles with sarcasm/cultural nuances in NLP
