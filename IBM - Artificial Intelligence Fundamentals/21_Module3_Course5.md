# Robustness in AI Ethics: Adversarial Challenges & Defenses

## What is Robustness in AI?
**Robustness** refers to an AI system’s ability to maintain reliable performance under diverse conditions, including:
- **Adversarial attacks** (intentional manipulations)  
- **Data noise** (e.g., sensor errors)  
- **Distribution shifts** (unseen scenarios)  

**Adversarial robustness** specifically addresses resilience against malicious inputs designed to deceive AI models.

## Adversarial Robustness in AI
### Definition
Adversarial robustness ensures AI systems:
- Resist **perturbations** (small, intentional input changes)  
- Maintain accuracy under **maliciously crafted inputs**  
- Avoid catastrophic failures in critical applications (e.g., healthcare, autonomous vehicles)  

### Example
- A self-driving car misclassifying a **perturbed stop sign** as a speed limit sign due to adversarial stickers.

## Categorizing Adversarial Attacks
### 1. **By Attacker Knowledge**
| Type                | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **White-Box**       | Attacker has full model access (architecture, parameters)                  |
| **Black-Box**       | Attacker interacts only with model outputs (no internal knowledge)         |

### 2. **By Attack Phase**
| Type                | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Evasion Attack**  | Tamper with **inputs during inference** (most common)                      |
| **Poisoning Attack**| Corrupt **training data** to degrade future performance                    |
| **Model Extraction**| Clone models via repeated queries                                           |

### 3. **By Goal**
| Type                  | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Targeted**          | Misclassify inputs into a **specific wrong class** (e.g., "cat" → "dog")   |
| **Untargeted**        | Cause **any misclassification** (e.g., "cat" → random class)               |

## Case Study: Evasion Attack on Medical Imaging
- **Scenario**: Adversarial noise added to X-rays hides tumors from AI diagnostics.  
- **Impact**: False negatives endanger patient lives.  
- **Defense**: Adversarial training + input anomaly detection.

---

## Ethical Implications
- **Safety Risks**: Robustness failures in autonomous systems (e.g., vehicles, drones).  
- **Trust Erosion**: Public skepticism toward AI due to vulnerability exploits.  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Mandates like EU AI Act require robustness assessments.

> **Key Takeaway**: Adversarial robustness is critical for ethical AI deployment.  
> Combine **technical defenses** (e.g., adversarial training) with **ethical governance** to ensure systems withstand real-world threats.
