## Code Example: Tiny Self-Supervised Learning  

    # Contrastive Learning Simplified (PyTorch)  
    import torch  
    import torch.nn as nn  

    class SSLModel(nn.Module):  
        def __init__(self):  
            super().__init__()  
            self.encoder = nn.Sequential(  
                nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3),  
                nn.ReLU(),  
                nn.MaxPool2d(2)  
            )  
            self.projection = nn.Linear(16*13*13, 128)  

        def forward(self, x1, x2):  
            # Augmented views of same image  
            z1 = self.projection(self.encoder(x1).flatten(1))  
            z2 = self.projection(self.encoder(x2).flatten(1))  
            return nn.CosineSimilarity()(z1, z2)

## Challenges Ahead  
1. **Regulatory Fragmentation**: Complying with conflicting AI laws (EU vs. US vs. China).  
2. **Security**: Adversarial attacks on vision models (e.g., road sign misclassification).  
3. **Workforce Gaps**: 2025 forecast: 97M AI roles unfilled (World Economic Forum).

## Conclusion  
The future of ML lies at the intersection of scale, efficiency, and ethics. Trends like neuromorphic hardware and neuro-symbolic systems will push AI beyond pattern recognition into reasoning and creativity. However, sustainable adoption requires addressing energy costs, bias, and global governance.
