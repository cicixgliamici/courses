# Introducing Threat Intelligence: Concepts, Frameworks, and Applications  

---

## Learning Objectives  
By the end of this module, you will be able to:  
1. **Define threat intelligence**.  
2. **Define tactics, techniques, procedures (TTPs), and indicators of compromise (IOCs)**.  
3. **Describe the benefits, sources, and emerging technologies for threat intelligence**.

## 1. What is Threat Intelligence?  
**Definition**:  
Threat intelligence is **analyzed data** about current or emerging cyber threats, providing context (e.g., attacker motives, capabilities) to help organizations proactively defend against attacks.  

**Example**:  
A report detailing a ransomware group’s infrastructure, including domains and malware hashes used in recent campaigns.

## 2. Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTPs) and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)  

| **Term**                | **Definition**                                                                 | **Example**                                      |  
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|  
| **Tactics**             | High-level goals of attackers (e.g., initial access, data exfiltration).       | Phishing to gain entry (MITRE ATT&CK TA0001).    |  
| **Techniques**          | Specific methods to achieve tactics (e.g., spear phishing, brute force).       | Exploiting CVE-2023-1234 for privilege escalation. |  
| **Procedures**          | Detailed steps attackers follow (tools, workflows).                            | Using Mimikatz to extract credentials post-breach. |  
| **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** | Observable evidence of a breach (e.g., IPs, file hashes, domains).       | Malicious IP `94.130.11.45` linked to Emotet.    |  

**Case Study**:  
- **TTPs**: APT29 (Cozy Bear) uses **spear phishing** (technique) for **initial access** (tactic).  
- **IOCs**: Malicious PDFs with SHA-256 hash `a1b2c3...`.

## 3. Benefits, Sources, and Emerging Technologies  

### A. **Benefits of Threat Intelligence**  
- **Proactive Defense**: Identify threats before they strike (e.g., blocking known malicious IPs).  
- **Improved Incident Response**: Accelerates containment using IOCs and TTPs.  
- **Risk Prioritization**: Focus resources on high-impact threats (e.g., ransomware vs. script kiddies).  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet mandates like GDPR Article 32 (security safeguards).  

### B. **Sources of Threat Intelligence**  
| **Source**               | **Description**                                                                 | **Example**                                      |  
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|  
| **Open-Source (OSINT)**  | Publicly available data (e.g., blogs, forums, vulnerability databases).        | CVE details from NVD, AlienVault OTX.            |  
| **Commercial Feeds**     | Paid services offering curated threat data.                                     | Recorded Future, FireEye Threat Intelligence.    |  
| **Government Alerts**    | Advisories from agencies like CISA, NCSC.                                       | CISA’s Shields Up alerts on Russian state threats. |  
| **Internal Telemetry**   | Logs, SIEM alerts, and incident reports from an organization’s own systems.    | Detection of unusual login patterns via Splunk.  |  

### C. **Emerging Technologies**  
- **AI/ML-Driven Analysis**: Tools like Darktrace use AI to detect anomalies and predict attack patterns.  
- **Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)**: Centralize data (e.g., ThreatConnect, Anomali).  
- **Automated IOC Enrichment**: Tools like MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) correlate IOCs with global threat feeds.  
- **MITRE ATT&CK Integration**: Map TTPs to defensive strategies (e.g., SentinelOne’s use of ATT&CK matrices).

## 4. Case Study: Leveraging Threat Intelligence  
**Scenario**: A financial institution detects suspicious network traffic.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. **IOC Check**: Cross-references IP `185.100.85.101` with VirusTotal → flagged as C2 server for Conti ransomware.  
  2. **TTP Analysis**: Matches behavior (lateral movement via RDP) to Conti’s MITRE ATT&CK profile (TA0008).  
  3. **Response**: Blocks IP, isolates affected systems, and deploys patches for CVE-2023-4567 (exploited vulnerability).  

**Outcome**: Breach contained within 2 hours; $2M in potential losses avoided.

## 5. Challenges and Future Directions  
- **Data Overload**: Filtering actionable insights from vast data volumes.  
- **Attribution Difficulty**: Linking attacks to specific threat actors (e.g., state-sponsored vs. cybercriminals).  
- **Quantum Threats**: Preparing for quantum decryption of historical data (harvest now, decrypt later attacks).

## Key Takeaways  
1. Threat intelligence transforms raw data into **actionable insights** using TTPs and IOCs.  
2. Combining **open-source**, **commercial**, and **internal** sources maximizes coverage.  
3. Emerging technologies like AI and TIPs are revolutionizing threat detection and response.
